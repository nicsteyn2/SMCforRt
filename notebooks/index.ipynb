        "\n",
        "- **Introduction:** We introduce key concepts such as the [renewal model](introduction.html) and [hidden-state models](intro-hiddenstatemodels.html). Those already familiar with these concepts can safely skip these pages.\n",
        "- **Sequential Monte Carlo:** We introduce specific SMC methods. This includes defining the [bootstrap filter](smc-bootstrap.html) and [particle marginal Metropolis Hastings](smc-pmmh.html).\n",
        "- **Models:** A collection of epidemic models accounting for various statistical artefacts. The focus in this chapter is on $R_t$ estimation.\n",
        "<!-- - **Prediction:** We use the models developed to [produce short-term forecasts](link.link), estimate the [probability of elimination](link.link), and [estimate missing data](link.link). \n",
        "- **Inference:** #TODO -->\n",
        "- **Evaluation:** We introduce key metrics for [model evaluation](eval-scoringrules.html), including [scoring rules](eval-scoringrules.html), [KL-divergence](eval-additionalnotes.qmd), and TBC.\n",
        "<!-- - **Additional models:** We demonstrate how these methods can be used for [epidemic forecasting](link.link), [inference](link.link), and [elimination probabilities](link.link). -->\n",

        "\n",
        "We recognise that Julia is not widely used in epidemiology. While we would love to implement our methods in R, they would be extremely slow without a C++ backend. Instead, our methods are all natively implemented in Julia and require no external software - making the entire process much simpler!\n",
