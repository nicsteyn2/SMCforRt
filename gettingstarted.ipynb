    "# Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "The code to reproduce the examples from the [primer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18875) is available in the `/paper/` directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code to reproduce the examples on the [website](https://nicsteyn2.github.io/SMCforRt/) is available in the `/notebooks/` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "We encourage you to [run the notebooks using binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nicsteyn2/SMCforRt/main), a free service with Julia pre-installed. This should run out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nicsteyn2/SMCforRt/main)\n",

    "## Installing Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia can be installed from the [official website](https://julialang.org/install/) by running the relevant command in your terminal/command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "For MacOS and Linux:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For Windows:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "winget install --name Julia --id 9NJNWW8PVKMN -e -s msstore\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual downloads are also available for all platforms [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/).\n",
    "\n",
    "All code has been tested on Julia 1.8.0, but we expect it to work on newer versions as well. If you encounter any issues, please let us know! Julia is a fast-growing language and we are working to keep up with the latest developments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using IJulia/Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks are written in Julia and can be run using IJulia, which is a Julia backend for Jupyter notebooks. To install IJulia, open a Julia REPL*:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "julia\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*A REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive programming environment. If you have ever run Python or R in a terminal, you have used a REPL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, run the following commands in the Julia REPL to install IJulia. IJulia comes with it's own mini Python and Jupyter installation which functions independently of your system Python and Jupyter installation (although you are free to use your system installation if you prefer). \n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "using Pkg\n",
    "Pkg.add(\"IJulia\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This only needs to be done once. Finally, run the following command to start the Jupyter notebook server:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "using IJulia\n",
    "notebook()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will open a new tab in your web browser with the Jupyter notebook interface. You can then navigate to the `/paper/` and/or `/notebooks/` directories and open any of the notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using VSCode (or another IDE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Many IDEs support running Julia code in .ipynb files. Opening the root directory of this repository in VSCode and then opening any of the notebooks should work out of the box, you just need to select your Julia installation as the kernel. The Julia extension for VSCode provides some useful features."
