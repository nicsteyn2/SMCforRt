# Example notebooks

These notebooks contain code required to reproduce the results in the paper [\#TODO: add link once preprint is live]. Data is loaded from the ``data`` directory of the github repository, and the resulting figures are saved in the ``paper/figures`` directory. The notebooks are organized as follows:

- ``00data.ipynb``: Load the data and produces figure 5 in the paper.
- ``01model.ipynb``: Defines and fits model 1 from the paper
- ``02model.ipynb``: Defines and fits model 2 from the paper
- ``03naive.ipynb``: Defines and fits the naive version of model 3 from the paper
- ``03dayofweek.ipynb``: Defines and fits the day-of-week version of model 3
- ``03tempagg.ipynb``: Defines and fits the temporally aggregated version of model 3
- ``03results.ipynb``: Combines and plots results from the different versions of model 3
